# Resistance Calculator for 4, 5, and 6 Band Color Codes
![Resistance Calculator](assets/resistance.png)
 >A Python resistor calculator for 4, 5, and 6 band resistor color codes. The GUI allows users to interactively select the colors of the resistor bands through comboboxes. Each band's color selection corresponds to a specific numerical value and tolerance, defined in the color_codes dictionary.  Upon selecting the band colors, the code triggers the calculate_resistance() function, which performs the necessary calculations to determine the resistance value based on the color codes. Additionally, depending on the chosen notation (4-band or 5-band), the function calculates the tolerance value accordingly.

## CHANGELOG 
 - Major version update: Version incremented (from v1.0 to v2.0)
 - Added support for 6-band resistor calculations including temperature coefficient.
 - Migrated GUI from Tkinter to PyQt6 framework to enhance user interface appearance and functionality.
 - Minor bug fixes and appearance/performance tweaks.
 - Rebuilt Windows binary with updated PyQt6 GUI and features.
 - The Linux binary remains at the previous version and will not be included in the upcoming release to shift the focus to Windows functionality.

## Description
The Resistor Calculator is a GUI application developed in Python using the PyQt6 framework. It enables users to calculate the resistance, tolerance, and temperature coefficient (for 6-band resistors) of resistors based on their color bands. The application supports 4-band, 5-band, and 6-band resistor types.

## Features
 - Select the number of bands (4, 5, or 6).
 - Choose colors corresponding to each resistor band.
 - Calculate resistance value and tolerance.
 - Display resistance range based on tolerance.
 - Display temperature coefficient for 6-band resistors.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8 or newer
- PyQT6 framework (pip install pyqt6)

## Usage Instructions

1. Select the number of bands on your resistor (4, 5, or 6).

### For 4-Band Resistors:

* Band 1: First significant figure
* Band 2: Second significant figure
* Band 3: Multiplier
* Band 4: Tolerance

### For 5-Band Resistors:

* Band 1: First significant figure
* Band 2: Second significant figure
* Band 3: Third significant figure
* Band 4: Multiplier
* Band 5: Tolerance

### For 6-Band Resistors:

* Band 1: First significant figure
* Band 2: Second significant figure
* Band 3: Third significant figure
* Band 4: Multiplier
* Band 5: Tolerance
* Band 6: Temperature coefficient (ppm/Â°C)

2. Select the corresponding color for each band from the dropdown menus.
3. Click the **Calculate** button to view resistance, tolerance, range, and temperature coefficient (if applicable).

## How to Determine the First Color Band

* The first band is usually closer to one end of the resistor.
* The tolerance band (gold, silver, or none) is typically separated by more space and located on the far right.
* Hold the resistor so the tolerance band is on the right; the first color band is then on the far left.
* For 5 and 6-band resistors, the first three bands represent significant figures; the subsequent bands are multiplier, tolerance, and optionally temperature coefficient.
